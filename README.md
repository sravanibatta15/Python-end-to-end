## 📚 Topics Covered  

### 🔹 Basics  
- **Data Types & Variables** – Learn about Python’s built-in data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Understand how variables store values and how dynamic typing works in Python.  
- **Print Statement & Input Handling** – Explore how to display messages to users using `print()` and take input using `input()`, including type conversion.  
- **Operators** – Covers arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, and bitwise operators. Learn how they are used to perform operations and control logic in expressions.  
- **Comprehensions** – A concise way to create lists, sets, and dictionaries in a single line of code. They make code shorter, cleaner, and more readable.  

### 🔹 Collections  
- **List** – Ordered, mutable collection that can hold mixed data types. Supports indexing, slicing, and powerful methods for data manipulation.  
- **Tuple** – Similar to lists but immutable, meaning values cannot be changed. Useful when data integrity needs to be maintained.  
- **Dictionary** – Stores data in key-value pairs, allowing fast lookups and updates. Ideal for structured and mapped data.  
- **Set** – An unordered collection of unique elements. Supports mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference.  
- **Strings** – A sequence of characters with powerful built-in methods for searching, formatting, and manipulating text.  

### 🔹 Control Flow  
- **Conditional Statements** – Allows decision-making in programs using `if`, `elif`, and `else`. Helps execute different code blocks based on conditions.  
- **Loops** – Automate repetitive tasks with `for` and `while` loops. Learn how iteration makes programs efficient and flexible.  
- **Loop Control Statements** – Manage loop execution with `break` to exit, `continue` to skip, and `pass` as a placeholder.  

### 🔹 Functions  
- **Defining & Calling Functions** – Functions are reusable blocks of code that improve modularity and readability. Learn how to define, call, and pass arguments.  
- **Lambda Functions** – Small, anonymous functions used for quick operations. Often combined with `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` for concise coding.  
- **Recursion** – A function that calls itself to solve a problem step by step. Useful for mathematical problems like factorials, Fibonacci, and tree traversal.  

### 🔹 Error & File Handling  
- **File Operations** – Learn how to open, read, write, and append files. File handling is essential for data storage and persistence in applications.  
- **Exception Handling** – Prevent program crashes by handling errors gracefully. Use `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `raise` to manage unexpected situations.  

### 🔹 Advanced Python  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** – A programming paradigm based on classes and objects. Covers inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation for building structured applications.  
- **NumPy** – A powerful numerical computing library. Provides multi-dimensional arrays, mathematical functions, and efficient data operations.  
- **Pandas** – A high-level library for data analysis and manipulation. Offers DataFrames and Series for handling tabular and structured data.  
- **Matplotlib** – A visualization library for creating static, animated, and interactive plots. Helps represent data in charts, graphs, and plots for analysis.
